# qr-splitter

This is a tool and Python library to take a (possibly large) block of
data and print that data onto one (or more) pages of QR codes.

It is useful to take e.g. a
[PSBT](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/psbt/) and print it for
offline signing by a
[HodlerGlacier](https://github.com/bitcoinhodler/GlacierProtocol)
quarantined laptop.

# How do I use it?

I don't know. It's not developed yet.
